# blockcell Technical Article Series: “A Self-Evolving AI Agent Framework”

> The English series index for blockcell currently contains 23 articles, all aligned to the real codebase and current product behavior. The Chinese documentation includes additional advanced skill tutorials and the Ghost Native learning design.

## Series overview

blockcell is an open-source AI agent framework written in **Rust**. It is not just a chat interface — it is an AI workbench that can execute tasks, keep memory, integrate tools, run channels, and evolve itself over time.

This series covers the product from first use to advanced architecture topics, including:

- what blockcell is and how to get started
- tools, skills, memory, channels, browser automation, and gateway mode
- self-evolution, subagents, Ghost, and the Hub community
- production-facing topics such as the CLI, provider config, MCP, provider pools, multi-profile intent routing, and multi-agent configuration
