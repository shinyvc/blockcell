## What is a tool?

In the AI agent world, “tools” are a core concept.

Put simply: **a tool is a function the AI can call.**

Without tools, an AI can only chat. With tools, an AI can:
- Read files → analyze content
- Search the web → retrieve up-to-date information
- Run commands → operate the system
- Send messages → notify you

blockcell includes **50+ built-in tools**, covering most common development and work scenarios.

## How do tools work?

When you tell the AI “read report.txt”, what happens under the hood?

```
1. Your input → LLM
2. The LLM decides it needs the read_file tool
3. The LLM generates tool parameters: {"path": "~/Desktop/report.txt"}
4. blockcell executes read_file and reads the file
5. The file content is returned to the LLM
6. The LLM generates a response based on the content
7. You see the answer
```

This is **tool calling**, the foundational mechanism behind modern AI agents.

Each tool exposes a **JSON Schema** describing its parameters. The LLM uses that schema to generate correct tool-call arguments.

Built-in types: explore / plan / verification / viper / general
```

**`spawn`** — start a background subtask
```
Best for: explicitly requested background work or long-running tasks
Limit: subtasks cannot call agent/spawn again, preventing recursive delegation
```

Interactive command: /tasks
```

For details, see [Subagents and task concurrency](./11_subagents.md).

          software (rustc/python3/node/git/docker/ffmpeg)
          network (connectivity/interfaces)
          current capability status
```

---

## Tool safety mechanisms

blockcell includes a path safety system:

```
Inside workspace (~/.blockcell/workspace): allowed automatically
Outside workspace: prompts for confirmation
Authorized directories: approve once, then allow automatically
Gateway mode: always denies outside-workspace access
```

This prevents the AI from modifying important files without your awareness.

---

## How to list all tools

```bash
blockcell tools
```

Example output:

```
Available tools (52):
  read_file        - Read file contents
  write_file       - Write content to file
  edit_file        - Edit file with string replacement
  web_search       - Search the web
  web_fetch        - Fetch web page content
  exec             - Execute shell command
  browse           - Browser automation via CDP
  finance_api      - Stock/crypto/forex data
  ...
```

---

## Extensibility

Besides built-in tools, blockcell also supports:

1. **Calling any API via `http_request`** — no dedicated tool required
2. **Executing any script via `exec`** — Python/Node/Shell all work
3. **Packaging complex flows as skills** — covered in the next article

---

## Summary

blockcell’s tool system is its core strength:

- **Broad coverage**: 50+ tools from files to finance, browsers to IoT
- **Works out of the box**: most tools need little to no extra configuration
- **Safety**: path confirmation protects your filesystem
- **Extensible**: expand endlessly via HTTP/exec/skills

Next, we’ll look at the Skill system — the key mechanism that makes capabilities reusable and evolvable.
